## WorldQuant Applied Data Science Lab:  My Data Science Superpower Journey! 🦸‍♀️

I’m bursting with excitement to announce that I’ve graduated from WorldQuant's Applied Data Science Lab! 🎓 This wasn't just a course; it was a full-blown data science bootcamp, and now I'm ready to unleash my newfound data superpowers! ✨

Get ready for a whirlwind tour of my 8 epic data adventures:

1. **Mexico Housing Hustle:**  We tackled the tricky question: location vs. size - which is king in Mexican real estate? We cleaned data like a pro, built cool visualizations, and used correlation to uncover the truth about property prices. 
2. **Buenos Aires Apartment Adventures:** Using a linear regression model, we predicted apartment prices in Argentina.  We wrangled missing data, encoded features, and even fought off overfitting to get the best model possible.
3. **Nairobi Air Quality Quest:** This project was a real-world challenge! We built an ARMA time series model to predict air pollution levels in Nairobi. We used pymongo to extract data from a MongoDB database and fine-tuned our model for peak performance.
4. **Nepal Earthquake Data Detectives:**  We built logistic regression and decision tree models to predict earthquake damage to buildings in Nepal. We even learned about data biases and discrimination that can creep into our models. 
5. **Poland's Bankrupt Business Battle:**  We used random forests and gradient boosting to predict if Polish companies would go bankrupt. We even navigated the Linux command line, a data scientist's secret weapon!
6. **US Customer Clustering Conundrum:**  We used a k-means model to cluster US consumers into groups. We even used principal component analysis (PCA) for some data visualization magic and created an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash – a truly dazzling project!
7. **WorldQuant University Email Experiment:**  We ran an A/B test to see if sending emails could increase enrollment in WorldQuant University programs. We built a custom ETL process and an interactive data application using a three-tiered design – talk about a data science party trick!
8. **India Stock Market Volatility Venture:**  We built a GARCH time series model to predict asset volatility in India.  We even built our own API to serve model predictions – we were like data science rockstars! 

WorldQuant, you guys rock! Thanks for an amazing learning experience. Now, it's time for me to unleash my data science superpowers on the world! 🌎🚀
