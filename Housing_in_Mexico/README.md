# Housing in Mexico Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes housing data in Mexico, focusing on the relationship between property area and price. It's part of the WorldQuant Data Science Program.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of property prices vs. area
- Statistical analysis including Pearson correlation

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization

## Main Analysis
The core analysis includes:
1. Scatter plot of property prices against area
2. Calculation of Pearson correlation between price and area

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed
2. Open the `Housing_in_Mexico.ipynb` notebook
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

## Results
The analysis provides insights into:
- Visual representation of price-area relationship in Mexican housing market
- Quantitative measure of correlation between property size and price

## Future Work
- Expand analysis to include more features
